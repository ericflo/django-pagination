Dear hackers and github fork owners: PLEASE MERGE BACK!
Regardless of the size of the delta, all fixes are welcome and important.

Some guidelines:
 * use pep8 / pyflakes to check if you are not introducing new issues by accident
 * test your changes (setup.py test)
 * write tests for now code if possible
 * do not commit '.mo' files - they do not belong here - they can be rebuilt from .po
 * propose a merge on github
